# Comprehensive Guide to Setting up Grafana, Prometheus, and Loki

## Why I Wrote This Guide
When I first started learning Grafana and Prometheus, I quickly realized that setting up these tools is not a one-size-fits-all process. Each environment—whether it's a traditional data center, Docker, or Kubernetes—presents unique challenges in configuration, integration, and optimization. There was a lack of comprehensive, step-by-step guides that addressed these nuances across different infrastructures, and I often found myself piecing together information from multiple sources.

This guide aims to be a one-stop resource for anyone looking to set up Grafana, Prometheus, and Loki in various environments. It includes practical examples, detailed configuration steps, and insights to help both beginners and experienced users build a robust monitoring and logging solution tailored to their specific setup. My goal is to make the learning curve smoother and help others avoid the challenges I faced along the way.

# 2. Understanding Grafana Data Sources

Grafana’s real power comes from its ability to connect to multiple data sources. Once you've got your data flowing in, Grafana helps you visualize it. Let’s take a look at some of the most commonly used data sources.

## 2.1 Prometheus (Metrics)
Prometheus is one of the most widely used monitoring systems. It collects metrics from your applications, servers, or infrastructure, and works especially well with Grafana to create powerful dashboards.

### How to integrate Prometheus with Grafana:
Once you have Prometheus running, add it as a data source in Grafana by navigating to `Configuration > Data Sources`. Select Prometheus and enter the URL where Prometheus is running (e.g., `http://localhost:9090`).

#### Sample PromQL queries:
- **CPU usage for all instances:** `sum(rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode!="idle"}[5m])) by (instance)`
- **Memory usage:** `node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes / node_memory_MemTotal_bytes * 100`

**Additional Resource:** Looking for pre-built Prometheus alerting rules? Check out this [Awesome Prometheus Alerts page](https://github.com/asifMuzammil/awesome-prometheus-alerts.git) for a comprehensive collection of alerting rules tailored for Kubernetes environments. 

[More details? Visit the official Prometheus Integration in Grafana](https://prometheus.io/docs/grafana/latest/).

## 2.2 Loki (Logs)
Loki is Grafana’s go-to tool for managing logs. It’s designed to be lightweight and works seamlessly alongside Prometheus, but while Prometheus focuses on metrics, Loki is used for logs.

### How to integrate Loki:
Add Loki as a data source by selecting `Configuration > Data Sources` in Grafana, choose Loki, and provide the URL where Loki is running (e.g., `http://localhost:3100`).

#### Sample LogQL queries:
- **Query logs for the keyword "error" in a specific job:** `{job="grafana"} |= "error"`

Find more in the [Loki documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/).

## 2.3 CloudWatch (AWS Monitoring)
If you're running infrastructure on AWS, connecting CloudWatch to Grafana is a must. This integration lets you monitor your AWS resources like EC2, Lambda, and RDS, all from Grafana.

### How to integrate CloudWatch:
In Grafana, go to `Data Sources > Add Data Source` and choose CloudWatch. You'll need to enter your AWS credentials or set up access through IAM roles.

Check out the [CloudWatch Integration documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/datasources/cloudwatch/) for more.

## 2.4 MySQL (Relational Databases)
Grafana can also pull data from relational databases like MySQL, allowing you to visualize query results directly from your database tables.

### How to integrate MySQL:
Add MySQL as a data source by providing your host, port, and credentials. You can then run SQL queries directly in Grafana to visualize your data.

#### Sample SQL query:
```sql
SELECT
    time AS "time",
    value
FROM
    metrics_table
WHERE
    $__timeFilter(time)
```

# 3. Setting up Grafana with Middleware (Prometheus, Loki) in Different Environments

Grafana works best when paired with middleware like Prometheus (for metrics) and Loki (for logs). In this section, we’ll install and configure Grafana with these middleware in various environments, giving you a strong foundation for monitoring.

## 3.1 Configuration of Grafana In Traditional Data Center
### Setting up Grafana and Middleware in a Traditional Data Center (on Physical Servers)
In a traditional data center setup, you can run Grafana alongside Prometheus and Loki on physical Linux servers. This setup gives you full control over both hardware and software, but scaling may require manual intervention.

#### Server Preparation in a Traditional Data Center
Ensure your server runs a supported operating system (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS).

For Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

For CentOS:
```bash
sudo yum update -y


```

### For Setup on Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://packages.grafana.com/oss/deb stable main"
sudo apt update && sudo apt install grafana -y
```

### For CentOS:
```bash
sudo yum install -y https://packages.grafana.com/oss/rpm/grafana-8.0.0-1.x86_64.rpm
```

### Start Grafana:
```bash
sudo systemctl start grafana-server
sudo systemctl enable grafana-server
```

**Access Grafana UI:** Adjust firewall settings to allow traffic on Grafana’s default port (3000). Open a web browser and go to `http://<your_server_ip>:3000`. Log in with the default credentials (`admin / admin`).

# 4. Setting up Grafana, Prometheus, and Loki in Docker

## 4.1 Install Grafana with Docker Image
### Pull and Run the Grafana Docker Container:
```bash
docker run -d --name=grafana -p 3000:3000 grafana/grafana
```

**Explanation for Docker command:**
- `-d`: Runs the container in detached mode, allowing it to run in the background.
- `--name=grafana`: Names the container “grafana” for easier management.
- `-p 3000:3000`: Maps port 3000 on the Docker host to port 3000 on the container, making Grafana accessible at `http://<docker-host-ip>:3000`.
